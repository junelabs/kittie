# Dashboard Conflict - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem
Next.js detected **two pages resolving to `/dashboard`**:
1. `app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` (old placeholder dashboard)
2. `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (new dashboard with onboarding modal)

## Solution Applied

### ✅ Step 1: Identified the Conflict
- Found duplicate dashboard files
- Old version: placeholder data, no onboarding
- New version: real Supabase data + OnboardingModal

### ✅ Step 2: Removed Old Dashboard
```bash
# Deleted conflicting file
rm app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx

# Removed empty directory
rmdir app/(app)/dashboard/
```

### ✅ Step 3: Verified Fix
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Success
- No route conflicts: ✅ Verified
- Dashboard structure: ✅ Clean

## Current Route Structure

```
/signup          → app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx
/dashboard       → app/dashboard/page.tsx
/dashboard/kit/* → app/(app)/kit/[kitId]/page.tsx
/dashboard/*     → Other routes in app/(app)/
```

## Next: Ready to Test!

### Before Testing

**1. Run the Migration** (if you haven't already)
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:
ALTER TABLE public.profiles
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS role text CHECK (role IN ('brand','agency'));

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_role ON public.profiles(role);
```

**2. Restart Your Dev Server**
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
cd /Users/davidbrantley/kittie
pnpm dev
```

**3. Test the Flow**

Go to: `http://localhost:3000/signup` (or whatever port pnpm shows)

**Expected Behavior:**
1. ✅ Signup form appears (no 404!)
2. ✅ After signup → redirects to `/dashboard`
3. ✅ Onboarding modal opens automatically
4. ✅ Complete onboarding steps
5. ✅ Modal closes, dashboard shows

### Test Checklist

- [ ] Can access `/signup` without 404
- [ ] Can create account
- [ ] Redirects to `/dashboard` after signup
- [ ] Onboarding modal appears
- [ ] Can select "Brand" role
- [ ] Can enter company name
- [ ] Can skip/complete import step
- [ ] Modal closes after completion
- [ ] Dashboard shows proper UI
- [ ] Refresh page → modal stays closed

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check TypeScript (should have no errors)
pnpm tsc --noEmit

# Find all page routes
find app -name "page.tsx" -type f | sort
```

## Files Modified
- ❌ Deleted: `app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- ✅ Kept: `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (with onboarding)
