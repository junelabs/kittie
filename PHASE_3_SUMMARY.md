# âœ… Phase 3: Middleware for Route Protection - COMPLETE!

## What Was Created

**File:** `middleware.ts` (at project root)

This middleware intercepts ALL requests to your protected routes and handles:
1. **Authentication checks** - Redirects unauthenticated users to login
2. **Session management** - Properly manages Supabase cookies
3. **Onboarding flow** - Ensures users complete onboarding before accessing the app
4. **Smart redirects** - Prevents loops and handles edge cases

## How It Works

### Protected Routes
The following routes now require authentication:
- `/dashboard/*` - Main dashboard
- `/kit/*` - Kit editor pages
- `/assets/*` - Asset management
- `/settings/*` - User settings
- `/billing/*` - Billing/subscription pages
- `/help/*` - Help pages
- `/onboarding/*` - Onboarding flow

### Authentication Flow

```
User tries to access /dashboard
         â†“
Is user authenticated?
    â”œâ”€ NO â†’ Redirect to /login?redirect=/dashboard
    â””â”€ YES â†’ Has user completed onboarding?
              â”œâ”€ NO â†’ Redirect to /onboarding
              â””â”€ YES â†’ Allow access to /dashboard
```

### Onboarding Flow

```
Authenticated user accesses protected route
         â†“
Check profiles.onboarded_at
    â”œâ”€ NULL â†’ Redirect to /onboarding
    â””â”€ HAS VALUE â†’ Allow access
```

```
User on /onboarding page
         â†“
Check profiles.onboarded_at
    â”œâ”€ NULL â†’ Allow access (complete onboarding)
    â””â”€ HAS VALUE â†’ Redirect to /dashboard (already done)
```

## Key Features

### 1. **Session Management**
- Properly handles Supabase cookies
- Updates session tokens on each request
- Ensures auth state is consistent

### 2. **Smart Redirects**
- Saves original destination when redirecting to login
- Prevents redirect loops
- Handles already-onboarded users gracefully

### 3. **Performance**
- Only runs on matched routes (not on every request)
- Efficient database queries (only fetches `onboarded_at`)
- Minimal overhead

### 4. **Security**
- Server-side checks (cannot be bypassed)
- Row Level Security policies apply
- Session validation on every request

## What Changed from the Plan

**Schema Alignment:**
- Your database uses `full_name` and `company` (not `business_name`)
- Middleware checks `onboarded_at` which exists in your schema
- Everything is compatible âœ…

## Protected Routes Configuration

The `matcher` in `middleware.ts` specifies which routes are protected:

```typescript
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/dashboard/:path*',
    '/kit/:path*',
    '/assets/:path*',
    '/settings/:path*',
    '/billing/:path*',
    '/help/:path*',
    '/onboarding/:path*'
  ]
}
```

This means:
- âœ… Public routes (/, /pricing, /features, etc.) are NOT protected
- âœ… Login page is NOT protected
- âœ… API routes are NOT protected by this middleware (they have their own auth)
- âœ… All app routes require authentication

## Testing the Middleware

### Test 1: Unauthenticated Access
1. **Open browser in incognito/private mode**
2. **Go to:** `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
3. **Expected:** Redirects to `/login?redirect=/dashboard`

### Test 2: Login Redirect
1. **Still in incognito, after being redirected to login**
2. **Log in successfully**
3. **Expected:** Redirects to `/dashboard` (the original destination)

### Test 3: New User Onboarding
1. **Create a new test user** (email not yet onboarded)
2. **Log in**
3. **Try to access `/dashboard`**
4. **Expected:** Redirects to `/onboarding`

### Test 4: Completed Onboarding
1. **As a user who completed onboarding**
2. **Try to access `/onboarding`**
3. **Expected:** Redirects to `/dashboard`

### Test 5: Direct Onboarding Access
1. **New user without onboarded_at**
2. **Access `/onboarding` directly**
3. **Expected:** Stays on `/onboarding` (allowed to complete it)

## Important Notes

### Server Components Still Use requireAuth()
Your server components (like dashboard/page.tsx) still call `requireAuth()`. This is fine! It provides:
- **Defense in depth** - Two layers of auth checking
- **User object access** - Server components can use the returned user
- **Explicit intent** - Clear that the page requires auth

The middleware is the **first line of defense**, and `requireAuth()` is the **second**.

### API Routes
API routes (like `/api/kits`) are NOT protected by this middleware. They should continue to use their own authentication:

```typescript
const { data: { user }, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
if (!user) return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
```

### Embed Routes
The `/embed/[kitPublicId]` route is **intentionally not protected** - it's for public sharing of kits.

## Troubleshooting

### Infinite Redirect Loop
**Problem:** Stuck redirecting between pages

**Solution:** Check that:
- User has `onboarded_at` set in profiles table
- Profile exists for the user
- Session is valid

### Not Redirecting to Onboarding
**Problem:** New users go straight to dashboard

**Solution:** Verify:
- Middleware matcher includes the route
- `onboarded_at` is NULL for the user
- Check browser console for errors

### Session Issues
**Problem:** Getting logged out unexpectedly

**Solution:**
- Check Supabase environment variables are set
- Verify cookies are being set correctly
- Check browser cookie settings

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Next Steps

Phase 3 is complete! âœ… Next up:

**Phase 4:** Update Login Page with Supabase auth
**Phase 5:** Create Onboarding Page
**Phase 6:** Add Email Verification UI
